# VGOP: LVM Volumes Group Operator

`vgop` is an operator aimed to manage LVM volumes group in a kubernetes cluster.

Although of general usage, it was initially designed as a companion tool for [topolvm](https://github.com/topolvm/topolvm), to allow its fully automated deployment.

Most of the code and the logic has been borrowed from [lvm-operator](https://github.com/openshift/lvm-operator). 
In fact, this project is mostly a repackaging of a part of this wider project.  

## Installation

`vgop` should be installed using helm. An OCI chart is provided, so installation (here in the `topolvm-system` namespace) 
can be performed as the following.

```
helm -n topolvm-system install vgop --create-namespace oci://quay.io/kubotal/charts/vgop --version=0.1.0-snapshot
```

## Usage

Once installed, creating LVM VolumeGroup is achieved by creating appropriate K8S resources. For example:

```
---
apiVersion: vgop.kubotal.io/v1alpha1
kind: LVMVolumeGroup
metadata:
  name: myvg1
  namespace: topolvm-system
spec:
  deviceSelector:
    paths:
      - /dev/sdc
      - /dev/sdd
  nodeSelector:
    nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
          - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
            operator: In
            values:
              - n0
```

or

```
---
apiVersion: vgop.kubotal.io/v1alpha1
kind: LVMVolumeGroup
metadata:
  name: myvg2
  namespace: topolvm-system
spec:
  deviceSelector:
    paths:
      - /dev/sde
  nodeSelector:
    nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchFields:
          - key: metadata.name
            operator: In
            values:
              - n0
```

## Configuration

`vgop`is deployed as a daemonset. By default, there will be a pod on each node of the cluster, except on the control plane.

daemonset configuration should be adjusted to deploy a pod only on the node hosting some storage.

### Storage on the control plane

Due to the 'taint/toleration' mechanism of K8S, `vgop` is not deployed on the control plane nodes. If you need to do so 
(For example for a single node test cluster), you must add some 'tolerations' in a local value file:

```
tolerations:
  - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
    operator: Exists
    effect: NoSchedule
  - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
    operator: Exists
    effect: NoSchedule
```

### Deploy only on specific nodes
